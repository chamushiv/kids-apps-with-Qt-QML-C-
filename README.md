# Kids Apps made with Qt / QML / C++

You can download this application and export it to any platform - iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, Mac, Amazon etc, since it is  a Qt Application. I have used both QML and C++ in developing this Application.

I have started to learn Qt and I have created 3 brain teaser kids' apps suitable for kids with age under 10 years, in a single application. This is my first ever Qt program! The entire project took approximately 8 hours since this is my first project.
The three applications include:
1. A drawing board for digital drawing
2. A speedometer which actually checks how fast you press the "Accelerate" button. In further updates, I plan to connect the Speedometer with the GPS navigation so that one could determine their true velocity. 
3. A simple game where one can see a cartoon map and choose where to go and the artwork also changes based on your selection.

All the artwork used were made by me.
